# BuildAI, a tool for building machine learning algorithims and programs on the web
One of the major drawbacks to machine learning is the length of time and manpower it takes to prototype and build a workable system.Most of the time it's very unclear about what data will work, how it will help the program, and if it is cost beneficial to implement.


BuildAI is a website that will provide tools for collecting data easily from websites dynamically or other sources(including pre collected data) and provide quick, **no code required** machine learning algorithims available online with a click. 

Testing algorithims and viability for projects will be easy, and industries that have been unable to fit in the power of machine learning will now be able to utilize this tool to quickly analyze and create viable models that can later be transformed into code for the build product. If clients do not wish to integrate their models into their programs natively we will also offer an API to access the trained model through a server.


The website will also provide an interactive learning course to teach students new to machine learning the fundamentals without much requirements.
